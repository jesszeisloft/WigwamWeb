Up until an embarrassingly recent time, I thought that the only qualifications "surf rock" artists needed were a California mindset, a reverb pedal, and a drug habit. Turns out, I was wrong. At least in part. The problem wasn't so much in the definition as it was in <a href = "surfrock_i2.html"> [...] </a></p></div>
