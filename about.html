		<!--<h2>ABOUT WIGWAM</h2>-->
		<p>Referring to your music, writing, or art as a "project" starves its legitimacy and takes away its credibility.<br><br> The word "project" suggests tedious work and a degree of personal removal, like an anxiety inducing school assignment.<br><br>Let it be known, to everyone everywhere, that your contribution to the artistic world of whatever isn't just a project, but a sincere reflection of your weirdest thoughts and most petty cares.<br><br>We created The Wigwam as a collaborative platform where we can lament, obsess, and romance over music. Everything will be considered. Fringe house show goers and pop stars alike.<br><br>To anyone who picks this up and reads it: Thank you. Our appreciation for you rivals our appreciation for New Order and Aretha Franklin.<br><br><em>Put together.</em></p>
